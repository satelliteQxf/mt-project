BEIJING — When the Australian government set out to write a new foreign policy paper, it faced hotly contested questions shaping the country’s future: Will China replace the United States as the dominant power in Asia? If so, how quickly?
The government’s answers came in a so-called white paper released last month by the administration of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. For sure, China is challenging the United States in Asia, though in the end, it argues, America will prevail and Australia can count on its security guarantor of the past 70 years.
But a prominent defense strategist, Hugh White, has disputed that view, arguing in a provocative new essay that China has arrived, the United States is fading and Australia must find a way to survive on its own.
The contrasting assessments have set off a debate in Australia about the durability of the American alliance and China’s intentions toward Australia.
The government tried to reassure the public that there was no need to make a choice between China, Australia’s biggest trade partner, and the United States, its security patron. Despite the America First policies of President Trump, who is unpopular in Australia, the United States of old would endure. Australia would deal with the changing environment, it said, by working “harder to maximize our international influence.”
The arguments come against a backdrop of concerns over China’s growing influence in Australia. These include allegations of Chinese meddling in Australian universities and news stories about ethnically Chinese businessmen with connections to the government in Beijing giving generously to election campaigns.
Australia’s heavy reliance on iron ore and energy exports to China has long raised questions about the need to diversify its economy. However, dependence on China has only grown, as an influx of Chinese students and travelers now also helps to sustain the higher education and tourism industries.
Australia has tried to balance its growing economic dependence on China with its longstanding post-World War II security relationship with the United States.
But China’s assertive behavior in the South China Sea, and Mr. Trump’s decision to abandon the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade pact America once sought to lead, have rattled the underpinnings of Australia’s policies.
Australia’s leaders have gone beyond the white paper’s careful reassurances, openly declaring that Australia must confront the shifting power dynamics of the region.
Mr. Turnbull has called this the first time in Australia’s history that its dominant trading partner was not also its dominant security partner. He argued that the country should see this as an opportunity and not a risk, but his comments were also laced with uncertainty and concern.
“Now power is shifting, and the rules and institutions are under challenge,” he said. “The major players are testing their relationships with each other, while undergoing rapid change themselves.”
Foreign policy experts say the white paper’s assessment of American staying power does not reflect a growing consensus among many Australian policymakers that the United States, at least under its current leadership, cannot be relied on as a stable partner.
Michael Fullilove, executive director at the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney, described what many Australians see as a fraying of the liberal international order because, he said, “the president of the United States is neither liberal in his inclinations nor orderly in his behavior.”
Many say it’s time for Australia to stop pretending about American intentions, and begin considering other options. This view has found one of its clearest and most strident voices in Mr. White, whose 27,000-word essay bluntly argues that Australia needs to wake up: The game is over and China has already won.
“We all underestimated China’s power and resolve and overestimated America’s,” wrote Mr. White, who worked on sensitive intelligence and military matters with the United States as a senior official at the Australian Defense Department. “Not only is America failing to remain the dominant power, it is failing to retain any substantial strategic role at all.”
In reply to the government’s paper, Mr. White said Australia’s stance was unrealistic because it clung too much to the vestiges of a fading power that would not be able to stay ahead of China’s economic strength.
“The paper has an elegiac feel, the sense of a sunset,” he said in an interview.
The biggest splash came from Mr. White’s recommendations for what Australia should do about an American retreat. Faced with what he called Chinese efforts to impose its influence and different political values, he said Australia will have to do more to defend itself, including perhaps even one day acquiring nuclear weapons.
He said China’s rise is likely to spark an arms race in the Asia-Pacific, with both Japan and South Korea likely to become nuclear powers within a couple of decades.
“And the logic that drives them has implications for others,” Mr. White said. Australia could remain a middle power, he said, by keeping only a small nuclear arsenal. “It might look something like Britain’s submarine-based nuclear force,” he wrote.
American officials have tried to counter such conclusions. During his visit to Sydney in April, Vice President Mike Pence told Australian business and government leaders that the United States remains Australia’s most vital economic partner, with American investment growing by 50 percent in the past three years.
Another sign that Washington may seek to reassure its Australian allies has been talk of the possible appointment of Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the United States commander in the Pacific, as the next ambassador to Australia. Some American officials have said they would welcome the move because it would send a message to China that the United States will not retreat.
Australian media have chimed in, calling Admiral Harris “China’s least favorite American.” Still, it’s far from clear whether that would be enough to offset the deep concerns here about President Trump.
Australia has also tried to hedge its bets by reaching out to other democracies in the region, particularly Japan and India. Citing concerns about China’s advance into the South China Sea, the government’s white paper backed the idea of joining India, Japan and the United States to promote a free and democratic Indo-Pacific region that could offset China.
In China, the Foreign Ministry took offense at the comments about the South China Sea, saying Australia had no business meddling. The state-run Global Times suggested China might retaliate with boycotts in tourism and higher education.
“Fortunately, the country is not that important and China can move its ties with Australia to a back seat and disregard its sensitivities,” the newspaper said.
In his essay, Mr. White warned that Beijing could use its growing naval power to ramp up pressure by contesting Australia’s claims to remote pieces of Australian territory, such as islands that it controls in the Antarctic, or by deploying forces to South Pacific neighbors, where China enjoys good relations.
Analysts sympathetic to the Turnbull government have pushed back, saying Mr. White’s essay paints an overly alarmist picture.
“While many of the trends in the region are concerning, White underestimates America’s stake in the region,” said Andrew Shearer, who was an adviser to former Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Mr. White is “is premature in reaching the conclusion that President Trump will acquiesce to Chinese supremacy, and that the United States is already withdrawing.”
Still, the essay performed a useful service, Mr. Shearer said, by drawing attention to the rapidly shifting balance of power in Asia and the need for a more coherent response by Washington.
Some Chinese analysts said Mr. White may have overstated China’s success in the region. “The U.S. is still very much wanted and needed by regional countries, including Australia. The white paper makes that clear,” said Zhang Baohui, professor of international affairs at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.
But by 2030, Mr. Zhang said, China will have won the geopolitical race. “Everyone will then live under the shadow of Chinese power,” he said.
America does not get entirely short shrift from Mr. White. “It won’t be the dominant power in Asia,” he wrote, “but it will have both the means and the motive to exert some influence over China’s conduct — including in East Asia — through the global system in which it will play a key role.”

北京——在着手编写新的外交政策文书时，澳大利亚政府要面对一个关系国家未来发展的激烈争议：中国是否会取代美国，成为亚洲的主导国？如果会，那又有多快呢？
澳大利亚总理马尔科姆·特恩布尔(Malcolm Turnbull)的政府上月发布的白皮书便有对此作了回答。白皮书称，中国确实在挑战着美国在亚洲的地位，但美国仍将是最后的赢家，而澳大利亚也可以继续依赖美国——这个70年以来澳大利亚国家安全的守护者。
但是著名国防战略师休·怀特(Hugh White)对此观点表示异议，他在一篇极具挑衅意味的新文章中指出，中国已经到来，美国正在退出，而澳洲必须“自寻活路”。
截然不同的看法，促使澳大利亚国内就澳美同盟的持久性以及中国对澳洲用意展开了争论。
政府试图安定民心，表示人们不需要在澳洲最大贸易伙伴中国和澳洲安全合作伙伴美国之间做出选择。尽管不受澳大利亚人欢迎的特朗普带来了“美国优先”政策，之前的美国依然存在。政府表示，澳大利亚将通过“更努力地扩大国际影响”以应对外部环境的变化。
争论的背景，则是人们对中国在澳影响力日益增强的担忧。这些担忧包括对中国插手澳大利亚大学的指控，以及与北京政府有关联的华裔商人在竞选活动中花费重金的新闻报道。
澳大利亚严重依赖对中国的铁矿石和能源出口，这早已引发了该国对经济多样性需求的疑问。然而，当下大量涌入的中国学生和游客也在帮助支撑着高等教育和旅游业，澳大利亚对中国的依赖只增不减。
在对中国不断增加的经济依赖和自二战后与美国存在已久的安全合作关系之间，澳大利亚正试图保持平衡。
但中国在南海的强硬举动，以及特朗普抛弃美国曾经打算领导的贸易协定——泛太平洋伙伴关系协定(Trans-Pacific Partnership)——的决定，动摇了澳大利亚政策的基础。
澳大利亚的领导者们并不局限于白皮书上的谨慎保证，而是公开声明，澳大利亚必须直面地区权力态势的转变。
特恩布尔称，主要贸易伙伴与主要安全合作伙伴不是同一国的情况，系澳大利亚历史上首例。他认为，澳大利亚应该将其视作一个机遇，而非危险，但他的评论也带有不确定性和担忧。
“现在权力正在转换，规章制度都面临着挑战，”他说。“主要推动者们正在检验着相互之间的关系，而他们自身也在经历着急剧的变化。”
外交政策专家表示，白皮书对美国影响力的评价并未反映出许多澳洲议员日益增强的共识，即至少以当前的领导层，美国是不能作为稳定的合作伙伴的。
悉尼洛伊国际政策研究所执行董事迈克尔·富利洛夫(Michael Fullilove)说，在许多澳洲人看来，这是自由主义国际秩序的动摇，因为“美国总统既没有自由主义的意愿，也没有条理清晰的行为。”
许多人表示，澳大利亚不应该继续在美国的意图上自欺欺人，是时候开始考虑其他选项了。休·怀特是这种观点最明确、最高声的支持者。在一篇27000词的文章中，他明确表示，澳大利亚需要醒过来：游戏已经结束，中国已经获胜。
“我们都低估了中国的实力和决心，也高估了美国的，”曾作为澳大利亚国防部高级官员与美国合作处理敏感情报和军事事务的休·怀特写道，“美国不只是无法继续做主导国，它连大体上的战略角色都无法维持。”
针对政府的白皮书，休·怀特表示澳大利亚的立场不切实际，因为他们对一个在淡出的势力残留了太多的依恋，这股势力无法超越中国的经济增长实力。
“这份文书有点伤春悲秋，有种日落的感觉，”他在一个访谈中说道。
而最大的轰动则是休·怀特提出的建议——在美国退出后，澳大利亚该如何应对。面对着这个施展着影响力、带着不同政治价值观的所谓中国力量，他表示澳大利亚要做得更多才能保卫自己，或许会包括在某天拥有核武器。
他表示，中国的崛起很可能会引发亚太地区的军备竞赛。在几十年内，日韩都可能成为有核国家。
“这背后的逻辑对其他人也有着启示，”休·怀特表示。他说，通过拥有少量核武器，澳大利亚或许能维持中等强国的地位。“大概会和基于潜艇的英国核力量差不多，”他写道。
澳大利亚官方试图反驳此类结论。美国副总统迈克·彭斯(Mike Pence)4月出访悉尼时，曾向澳大利亚商界和政府领导人表示，美国仍是澳大利亚最重要的经济伙伴，在过去三年间，美国对澳投资有50%的增长。
华盛顿可能会努力让它的澳大利亚盟友们放心的另一个迹象是，它正在讨论由美国太平洋司令部司令、海军上将小哈里·B·哈里斯(Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr.)担任下一任驻澳大利亚大使。有些美国官员表示，他们会欢迎这一举措，因为它将向中国发出一个信息：美国不会退却。
澳大利亚媒体也发表了意见，称哈里斯上将是“最不受中国欢迎的美国人”。不过，这是否足以抵消澳大利亚对特朗普的深刻担忧，还远未可知。
澳大利亚还试图通过接触该地区的其他民主国家，尤其是日本和印度，来降低风险。澳大利亚政府的这份白皮书提到了对中国进军南海的担忧，赞同与印度、日本和美国一起，促进印度太平洋地区的自由和民主，抵消中国的影响。
中国外交部对这份白皮书中有关南海的评论表示不满，称澳大利亚没有干涉的理由。官方媒体《环球时报》表示，中国可以通过抵制旅游和高等教育进行报复。
“好在这是个说重要就重要，说不重要就不重要的国家，中国可以把同澳大利亚的关系适当往后排，忽视它青春期一般的敏感和矫情，”该报称。
怀特在自己的文章中警告称，北京可以利用自己日益增强的海军力量施加压力，挑战澳大利亚对偏远领土的主权主张，比如它在南极控制的岛屿，或者在与中国关系良好的南太平洋国家部署军力。
支持特恩布尔政府的分析人士反驳称，怀特的文章描绘了一幅过于危言耸听的画面。
“虽然该地区的很多趋势令人担忧，但怀特低估了美国在该地区的利益，”前总理托尼·阿博特(Tony Abbott)的顾问安德鲁·希勒(Andrew Shearer)表示。他还认为，怀特现在“得出特朗普总统将默许中国的霸权，美国已经开始后撤的结论还为时过早”。
希勒表示，尽管如此，这篇文章还是非常有用，让人们注意到，大国在亚洲的力量对比正在发生变化，华盛顿需要做出更一致的回应。
一些中国分析人士表示，怀特可能夸大了中国在该地区的成功。“那个地区的国家，包括澳大利亚在内，依然非常需要美国。白皮书表明了那一点，”香港岭南大学的国际事务教授张泊汇表示。
不过张泊汇表示，到2030年，中国将赢得这场地缘政治竞赛。“到那时，所有人都将生活在中国的势力影响之下，”他说。
怀特并没有完全忽视美国。“它不会成为亚洲的主导力量，”他写道，“但它仍将有通过全球体系——它仍将在其中发挥关键作用——对中国的行为施加影响的途径和动力，包括在东亚。”

BEIJING - When embarking on the preparation of a new foreign policy instrument, the Australian government faces a heated debate over the future of the country: will China replace the United States and become the dominant power in Asia? If so, how fast?  
The White Paper released by the government of Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last month answered this question. The White Paper said China is indeed challenging the U.S. presence in Asia, but the United States will remain the eventual winner and Australia can continue to rely on the United States, the guardian of Australian national security for 70 years.  
But Hugh White, a well-known national defense strategist, disagreed. He pointed out in a very provocative new article that China has arrived, that the United States is withdrawn and that Australia must "find its own way."  
The diametrically opposed views have prompted Australia's domestic debate on the sustainability of the Australia-US alliance and on China's intention to Australia.  
The government is trying to calm its people by saying that people do not need to make a choice between China, Australia's largest trading partner, and Australia's security partner, the United States. Although Trump, which was unpopular with Australians, had a "U.S. priority" policy, the former United States still existed. The government said Australia will adopt "more efforts to expand its international presence" in response to changes in the external environment.  
The background of the debate is that people are increasingly worried about China's growing influence in Australia. These concerns include allegations of China's involvement in Australian universities and news reports that Chinese- speaking businessmen associated with the Beijing government are spending heavily on campaigning.  
Australia's heavy reliance on exports of iron ore and energy to China has long raised doubts about the country's demand for economic diversity. However, the current influx of Chinese students and tourists is also helping to support higher education and tourism, and Australia's reliance on China only increases.  
Australia is trying to maintain a balance between its growing economic dependence on China and its long-standing security cooperation with the United States since World War II.  
However, China's tough move in the South China Sea and the decision of Trump to abandon the trade agreement that the United States intended to lead, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, have shaken the foundations of Australian policy.  
Instead of being a cautious guarantee on the white paper, Australia's leaders publicly stated that Australia must face a change in the regional power landscape.  
Turnbull said that it is the first time in Australia's history that major trading partners and major security partners are not in the same country. He believes that Australia should see it as an opportunity, not a danger, but his comments are also with uncertainty and concerns.  
"Right now power is changing and the rules and regulations are facing challenges," he said. "The main facilitators are testing the relationship with each other, and they themselves are undergoing dramatic changes."  
Foreign policy experts say the White Paper's assessment of U.S. influence does not reflect the growing consensus among many members of Australia that, at least with the current leadership, the United States can not be a stable partner.  
Michael Fullilove, an executive director at the Sydney-based Institute for International Policy Studies, said that in the eyes of many Australians it is a shake-off of the liberal international order because "the president of the United States has neither the will to liberal nor the Clarify behavior. "  
Many say Australia should not continue to fool itself into the United States intentions, it is time to begin considering other options. Hugh White is the clearest and loudest supporter of this view. In a 27,000-word article, he made it clear that Australia needs to wake up: the game is over and China has won.  
"We both underestimated China's strength and determination and overestimated the United States," wrote Hugh White, who worked with the U.S. as a senior intelligence official in the defense of sensitive intelligence and military affairs in the United States. "The United States is not only unable to continue to be the dominant force It can not even maintain its strategic role in general. "  
Hugh White, on the government's white paper, said that Australia's position is unrealistic because they remain too much attached to a fading force that can not surpass China's economic growth.  
"This document is a little bit sad, a sunset feeling," he said in an interview.  
And the biggest sensation is Hugh White's suggestion - how to deal with Australia after the United States withdrew. Faced with this so-called Chinese force that exerts influence and carries different political values, he said that Australia needs to do more to defend itself and may include possession of one day's nuclear weapons.  
He said that China's rise is likely to trigger an arms race in the Asia- Pacific region. In decades, both Japan and South Korea may become nuclear- armed.  
"The logic behind this also has implications for everyone else," Hugh White said. He said that Australia may be able to maintain its position as a medium- power country by having a small amount of nuclear weapons. "It will probably be about the same size as a submarine-based British nuclear force," he wrote.  
Australian authorities have tried to disprove such conclusions. When U.S. Vice President Mike Pence visited Sydney in April, he told Australian business and government leaders that the United States remains Australia's most important economic partner and that in the past three years, the United States has invested 50% of its investment in Australia increase.  
Another sign that Washington may try to reassure its allies in Australia is that it is discussing the role of Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, as Adm. Ambassador to Australia. Some U.S. officials said they would welcome the move because it will send a message to China that the United States will not retreat.  
The Australian media also expressed its opinion that General Harris is "the most unpopular American in the world." However, it is far from clear whether this is enough to offset Australia's deep concern about Trump.  
Australia is also trying to reduce its risk by getting into contact with other democracies in the region, notably Japan and India. The Australian government's white paper mentions its concern about China's march into the South China Sea and its support for working with India, Japan and the United States to promote freedom and democracy in the Indian Pacific region and offset China's impact.  
The Chinese Foreign Ministry expressed dissatisfaction with the comments in this white paper on the South China Sea and said Australia has no reason to interfere. The official Global Times newspaper said China can retaliate against tourism and higher education.  
"But fortunately this is a country where importance is important and insignificance is not important. China can rearrange relations with Australia appropriately and ignore its adolescent-like sensitivity and hypocrites," the newspaper said.  
In his article, White warned in his article that Beijing could use its growing naval force to pressure Australia to challenge its sovereignty over remote territories such as its Antarctic-dominated islands or its deployment in the South Pacific countries that have good relations with China .  
Analysts who backed the Turnbull administration retorted that White's article portrays an overly alarmist picture.  
"While many of the trends in the region are worrisome, White underestimated the U.S. interest in the region," said Andrew Shearer, a former adviser to Tony Abbott. He also believes it is still too early to "conclude that President Trump will acquiesce to China's hegemony and that the United States has begun to retreat."  
Still, Hiller said the article is very useful, however, to draw attention to the fact that the balance of power in the great Powers in Asia is changing and that Washington needs a more unanimous response.  
Some Chinese analysts said White may overstate the country's success in the region. "There is still a huge need for the United States in that region, including Australia, and the white paper shows that," said Zhang Parker, an international affairs professor at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.  
However, Bo Parker said that by 2030, China will win the geopolitical competition. "By that time, everyone will live under the influence of China," he said.  
White did not completely ignore the United States. "It will not become the dominant force in Asia," he wrote. "But it will still have the means and impetus to influence China's behavior through the global system where it will still play a key role, including in East Asia "
